#Machine learning 
This is my first Machine-learning project on linear regression using single variable. To achieve the prediction, I imported the necessary libraries such as pandas, matplotlib and scikit learn.
Next step was to load and read the dataset obtained from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jazNUpO3lQ&list=PLeo1K3hjS3uvCeTYTeyfe0-rN5r8zn9rw&index=3
I then visualized the dataset, which showed an increase trend over the years with the net national income. 
Based on the observed trend, I trained the linear regression model using the available dataset and predicted the net national income for the year 2020.
